When I began as a computer science graduate student at Miami University, I investigated many different topics as potential Masters thesis focuses. One of these subjects was logic programming and controlled natural languages. I wrote a rather lengthy background document for this subject and have included it here. 

It is worth noting that this is NOT the topic that I would go on to pursue most-heavily. Thus, this background document was never submitted.
